# LMCDatabase
# About

This Database was build using PHP, HTML, and SQL. 
Tested on a local server (PHPMYAdmin)

# Purpose

Current functionality allows workers at the Language Media Lab take inventory.
They are able to add and remove items from the database. In the future the database
will be web-based and it will allow professors to check in and check out equipment
from the LMC. Login functionality and equipment status is currently being worked on.

# ... In Progress (:
